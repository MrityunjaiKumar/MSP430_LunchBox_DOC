What is MSP430 LunchBox?
========================
MSP430 Lunchbox is an microcontroller platform based on `TI's MSP430G2553 IC <https://www.ti.com/product/MSP430G2533>`_. The TI MSP family of ultra-low-power microcontrollers consists of several devices that feature different
sets of peripherals targeted for various applications. The architecture, combined with five low-power
modes, is optimized to achieve extended battery life in portable measurement applications. The device
features a powerful 16-bit RISC CPU, 16-bit registers, and constant generators that contribute to
maximum code efficiency. The digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) allows the device to wake up from lowpower modes to active mode in less than 1 Âµs. LunchBox utilises the BSL mode for programming the MCU. 

MSP430 LunchBox was developed at `TI CEPD, Netaji Subhash University of Technology, New Delhi <http://cedtnsit.in/>`_. More details on design and development of this board can be found at this `blog <http://dvgadre.blogspot.com/2017/01/make-yourself-msp430-lunchbox-for-1.html>`_.

MSP430 LunchBox is being manufactured and marketed by `SincGrid LLP <http://sincgrid.in/>`_.
